//********RESPONSIVE IMAGES*************//

http://github.com/nwtn/pres-respimg-perf-wcto


A proportional method of dealing with responsiveness:
 img{
 	max-width:100%;
 }

 Avg Page Size - 1.9 mb
 Images account for 1.2 mb of this

 A better solution
 - provide an approprate image to the user based on their screen context



 File Formats
 WebP - Google's compression format for images, only supported in chrome
 SVG
 JPEG XR
 JPEG 2000

 Using a background image in CSS is not a good idea, it will impact SEO and neglect alt tags, so the browser won't actually read the image as content of the page

 Markup For Image Resolution Switching

 ie. <img src="picture.jpg" alt="picture">

 New way:

  ie. <img src="picture.jpg" alt="picture" 
  	srcset="picture1.jpg 0.5x, picture2.jpg 1x, picture3.jpg 2x..etc."
  >

  Viewport Resolution Switching
  new img attribute: sizes - tells the browser how wide the image will be displayed

  vw CSS - dimensions used to denote the width of the viewport width. i.e. 100vw is the full window width


  File Type Switching
  <picture> element is new
  You need to place an image as the last item within the picture tag
  ie.
  <picture>
  	<source type="image/webp" srcset="wolf.webp"
  	<img src="web.jpg" alt="">
  </picture>
